WE HIGHLY RECOMMEND USING THE WEBSITE, http://brodyvogel.georgetown.domains/Group4Project.htmlEverything – including code from our previous two projects – can be found there. Also, most of the plotly visualization features are lost in the pdf.“Group 5 Project 3.py” is the python code used to complete the parts of the project specific to the third section of the assignment. “SPORTS_FINAL_.csv” contains our sports data.“STOCKS_FINAL_.csv” contains our stocks data.“Group_5_Project_Website__PDF.pdf” is just a converted pdf of our website, made using https://www.web2pdfconvert.com/.“Website_Visualizations_PDF.pdf” is similarly a converted pdf of the visualizations page on our website, also made using https://www.web2pdfconvert.com/.The tableau visualizations didn’t come through in the website-to-pdf conversions, so they’re included as “Tableau 1” and “Tableau 2”.
